# mmaStats

### Description

A mini-project to extract and visualise the relationships and statistics of mixed martial arts (MMA) fighters.

        ```1) mmacreatepy.py: Create sqlite database and schema for holding data
        
        2) mmascrape.py: Scrape mma website for fighters' data.
        
        3) mmajson.py: create json file (mma.js) for visualising a force-directed graph by using D3.JS.
        
        4) force.html: use this together with d3.v2.js, mma.js, force.js in the same folder to visualize in a web-browser. (Might include more visualization when I have time).```

This project was done to fulfil the requirements of Python for Everyone capstone project; taught by University of Michigan, and hosted by Coursera.org.
